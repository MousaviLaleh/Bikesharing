# Bikesharing
This project is an analysis of New York Citi-Bike System data, using data visualization tools to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

## Purpose
Using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) and create a set of visualizations that :
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### New York City data visualization for August 2019
![01.png](images/01.png)

- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.

### August peak hours

- Highest activity hours are from 7-8 am and 5-7 pm and require the most resources mobilized.
- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.


### Checkout times for users

- Bikes are mostly checked out for 4 to 6 hours.

### Checkout times by Gender
