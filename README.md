# Bikesharing
This project is an analysis of New York Citi-Bike System data, using data visualization tools to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

## Purpose
Using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/), create visualizations that show:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
